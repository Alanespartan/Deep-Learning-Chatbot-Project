# Deep Learning Chatbot Project

## System Requirements
* Python 3.9.5 x64 bit (Tensorflow doesnâ€™t run on 32-bit distributions)
* Tensorflow 2.5.0
* Keras 2.4.3
* nltk 3.6.2
* numpy 1.19.5

## Test Chatbot
### Create Model
```
python train.py
```

### Run Chatbot
```
python chat.py
```

### Medical Support Intent Dataset Messages
